# EC2 Instance User Manager

Module used in conjunction with the [ec2_instance_user](../ec2_instance_user) module to manage Linux users in EC2 instances. This module should be deployed prior to the other one.

EC2 instances must have the "AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore" managed AWS policy attached to their instance role.

Module documentation is in the [wiki](hhttps://github.com/HealthcareBlocks/hcblocks-terraform-modules-aws/wiki/ec2_instance_user_manager).
