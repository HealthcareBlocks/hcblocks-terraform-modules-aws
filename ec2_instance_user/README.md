# EC2 Instance User

Module used in conjunction with the [ec2_instance_user_manager](../ec2_instance_user_manager) module to manage Linux users in EC2 instances.

EC2 instances must have the "AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore" managed AWS policy attached to their instance role.

Module documentation is in the [wiki](hhttps://github.com/HealthcareBlocks/hcblocks-terraform-modules-aws/wiki/ec2_instance_user).
